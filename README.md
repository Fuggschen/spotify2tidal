# spotify2tidal
spotify2tidal moves playlists, favorite albums and tracks and following artists from a Spotify account to a Tidal account.
It combines [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) and [tidalapi](https://github.com/tamland/python-tidal) to do so.

## Fork of the Spotify2Tidal application
For now use the source files and change it accordingly to your needs. Updated ready-to-use-files follow later
